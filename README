MESSAGE QUEUE

Requirements:
-------------
Make sure you have the following software already
installed before proceeding:

- Java 1.6
- Make
- Python 2.6 (with virtualenv installed)


Installation:
-------------
After downloading the repository for the first time, 
cd into the directory and run make.

This will do the following:
- Create a virtual python environment 
- Install required python packages into this environment
- Fetch the cassandra server and set up the configuration

After make completes all of these tasks, if it hasn't
terminated with an error then everything should be set.

The default (Cassandra) stores its data and files inside the local cassandra
directory so as not to interfere with any existing Cassandra installations on
the system.

In addition, you'll need to start Cassandra and create the
schema:
* bin/cassandra/bin/cassandra-cli -host localhost --file etc/cassandra/schema.txt

Running the Server:
-------------------
The message store (used by the server to route messages)
and the HTTP server must be started separately. The steps
are (starting from the root project directory)

1. Run "./bin/cassandra/bin/cassandra -p cassandra.pid"
   to start the message broker. 
   To shut it down at any point in the future, run 
   "kill -2 `cat cassandra.pid`"

2. Run "bin/paster serve development.ini" to start the
   MessageQueue Service.
